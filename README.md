## üöÄ Installation

### Method 1: Manual Installation
1. Download plugin files to `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-knowledge-assistant/` directory
2. Enable the plugin in Obsidian settings
3. Configure your OpenAI API key

### Method 2: Community Plugin (Coming Soon)
1. Open Obsidian Settings ‚Üí Third-party plugins ‚Üí Community plugins
2. Search for "Knowledge Assistant"
3. Install and enable the plugin

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Basic Operations

1. **Open Plugin**: Click the üß† icon in the sidebar
2. **Select Mode**:
   - üîç **Search**: Enter descriptions for semantic search (check semantic search option, otherwise keyword search only)
   - üí¨ **Q&A**: Enter questions to get intelligent answers based on your notes

### Smart Q&A Explained

Smart Q&A is the core feature of this plugin, working through:

1. **Question Understanding**: AI analyzes your question intent and key information
2. **Content Retrieval**: Searches for relevant information snippets in your note vault
3. **Answer Generation**: Generates accurate, helpful answers based on retrieved content
4. **Source Attribution**: Clearly marks the source files for each piece of information

**Usage Example**:

**Input Question**: What are the main types of machine learning?

**AI Answer**:
Machine learning is mainly divided into three types:

1. **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data to train models, such as classification and regression problems [Source 1]
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Discovers hidden patterns from unlabeled data, such as cluster analysis [Source 2]
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns optimal strategies through interaction with the environment, such as game AI [Source 1]

**Reference Sources**:
- [1] Machine Learning Basics.md
- [2] Introduction to Data Science.md

**One-Click Copy**: Click the üìã copy button, and the answer will be automatically converted to Obsidian double-link format:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Basic AI Configuration
- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for AI functionality
- **API URL**: Default OpenAI official address, customizable for other compatible services
- **Model Selection**: GPT-3.5-turbo (fast & economical), GPT-4-turbo (high quality)
- **Temperature Setting**: 0.0-1.0, controls creativity and randomness of responses
- **Local Embedding**: Optional local vector model support

### Search Settings
- **Folder Access Control**: Limit search scope to specific folders
- **File Size Limit**: Skip oversized files to optimize performance
- **Max Search Results**: Control the number of returned results
- **Similarity Threshold**: Set minimum similarity requirement for semantic search

### Cache and Performance

- **Cache Expiration**: Automatic cache update interval
- **Cache Management**: Manual cache cleanup options
- **Batch Size**: Control batch size for vectorization processing

## üîß Advanced Features

### Custom API Endpoints
Support for third-party OpenAI-compatible services:
- **Azure OpenAI**: `https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/your-deployment/`
- **Local Models**: `http://localhost:1234/v1`
- **Proxy Services**: `https://your-proxy.com/v1`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Features

- **Vector Search**: Uses cosine similarity for semantic relevance calculation
- **Smart Chunking**: Automatically splits long documents into appropriate segments
- **Incremental Indexing**: Only re-creates vectors for modified files
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry and error handling mechanisms
- **Multi-language Support**: Chinese and English interface switching

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **API Costs**: Using OpenAI API incurs costs, monitor usage recommended
2. **Network Connection**: Requires stable internet connection for AI services
3. **First Use**: Initial vector index creation takes time, please be patient
4. **File Formats**: Primarily supports Markdown format, limited support for others
5. **Privacy Security**: Note content is sent to AI service providers, consider privacy protection

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Error Code Explanations

- `API_KEY_INVALID`: Invalid or expired API key
- `NETWORK_ERROR`: Network connection issues
- `QUOTA_EXCEEDED`: API quota exceeded
- `FILE_TOO_LARGE`: File exceeds size limit
